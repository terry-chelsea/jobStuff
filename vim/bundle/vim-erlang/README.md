# Erlang indentation and syntax for Vim

This is the Erlang indentation and syntax that is shipped with Vim (from Vim 7.4).

## Installation

### Method 1

- Clone this repository:

        $ mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle
        $ cd ~/.vim/bundle
        $ git clone https://github.com/hcs42/vim-erlang-runtime

- Add the repository path to `runtimepath` in your `.vimrc`:

        :set runtimepath^=~/.vim/bundle/vim-erlang-runtime/

### Method 2

- Copy `syntax/erlang.vim` into `~/.vim/syntax/`.
- Copy `indent/erlang.vim` into `~/.vim/indent/`.

## Development and testing

This section is relevant only if you want to be involved in the development of
the script.

The indentation script can be tested in the following way:

- Copy `syntax/erlang.vim` into `~/syntax`.
- Open `test_indent.erl` in Vim from this directory. (`test_indent.erl` always
  shows how the Erlang code is indented by the script â€“ not how it should be.)
- Source `helper.vim` (`:source helper.vim`)
- Press F1 to load the new indentation (`indent/erlang.vim`).
- Press F3 to reindent the current line. Press shift-F3 to print a log.
- Press F4 to reindent the current buffer.
- Press F5 to show the tokens of the current line.

*Note:*

- When the indentation scripts detects a syntax error in test mode (i.e. when it
  was loaded with `F1` from `helper.vim`), it indents the line to column 40
  instead of leaving it as it is. This behavior is useful for testing.
